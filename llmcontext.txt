# dirtree

## Root Directory

- **__init__.py**: This file, __init__.py, serves as the entry point for the 'dirtree' project. It imports the main functionality from the 'main' module, including the 'main' and 'write_directory_tree' functions. It also defines the version number for the project as "0.1.5". Understanding this file is crucial for understanding how the project is structured and how the main functionality is accessed.
- **main.py**: The `main.py` file in the `dirtree` project is responsible for generating a visual directory tree structure and creating a comprehensive context file for LLM interactions. It implements functions for writing the directory tree to a file, determining if a file is a text file, estimating the number of tokens in text, parsing gitignore patterns, and checking if a file should be ignored based on gitignore patterns. The file also includes functions for collecting text files for context generation, splitting a file into chunks, calling the OpenAI API for text completion, generating summaries for large files, and generating file summaries and project context for LLMs. The main function parses command line arguments and orchestrates the generation of the directory tree and LLM context.
